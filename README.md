# RPG
In this project, I am building an RPG game to get familirize myself with HTML, 
CSS and JavaScript by following freeCodeCamp tutorial.

# What this program do?
It is a basic Role Playing Game. The user have three attributes: XP, Health and Gold.
The user can go to cave, go to store to buy weapons or health by using the coins or 
fight the dragon.

# Necessities
Once compiled with the javascript file, the interface html file will be able to 
give the user to play the game with the design provided by the CSS file.
