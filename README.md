# RPG
In this project, I am building an RPG game to get familiar with HTML, 
CSS and JavaScript by following freeCodeCamp tutorial.

# What this program do?
It is a basic Role Playing Game. The user have three attributes: XP, Health and Gold.
The user can go to cave, go to store to buy weapons or health by using the coins or 
fight the dragon.

**Go to Store:** Lets the user buy health or gold for the next fight.<br />
**Go to cave:** Lets the user fight with a slime or fanged beast monster by attacking, dodging or running. The user's XP, health and gold is updated by the actions. The user gets experience and enough gold and health to become prepared for fighting the dragon.<br />
**Fight dragon:** Lets the user to fight the dragon by attacking, dodging or running. If the user doesn't have enough XP, health and gold, it will die and the game is restarted.<br />

# Necessities
Once compiled with the javascript file, the interface html file will be able to 
give the user to play the game with the design provided by the CSS file.
